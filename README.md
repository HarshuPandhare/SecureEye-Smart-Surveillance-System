# SecureEye-Smart-Surveillance-System
Our project is a real-time weapon detection system that identifies potential threats from surveillance or device cameras. The system sends instant alerts to security staff to enable quick response and prevent incidents. It also keeps a record of detections and provides a dashboard for live monitoring and analysis.
